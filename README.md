# Hate It 'N Rate It

Hate It 'N Rate It allows users to rate ( and hate ) movies displaying on the website. User must be logged in to be able to submit their ratings on each movie, otherwise users are able to see the movies average rating. We built this project within two weeks for the Turings School of Software and Design 3rd module.
